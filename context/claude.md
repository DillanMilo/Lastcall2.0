# Claude & Cursor Behavior Guidelines

- Always load all context markdowns before generating or editing code.
- Follow TypeScript best practices.
- Adhere strictly to UI, UX, backend, and AI guidelines.
- If uncertain, ask for clarification.
- Never invent details not found in schema or context.
- Prioritize correctness and readability over brevity.
- Each file must compile without errors.
- Keep files under 500 lines.
- Never generate unreferenced or placeholder files.
- Avoid hallucination; output only based on defined structure and schema.
