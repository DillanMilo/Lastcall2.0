## 🆘 Having Issues?

### Nothing works after adding credentials

1. Check `.env.local` format (no quotes needed)
2. Restart dev server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
3. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console for errors

### Can't import data

1. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
2. Check tables exist in Supabase Table Editor
3. Confirm CSV format matches template
4. Look at browser console for detailed errors

### AI labeling not working

1. Verify OpenAI API key is valid
2. Check you have API credits
3. Restart dev server after adding key
4. Try importing without AI first (will skip labels)
