# üé® AI Assistant Customization Guide

## üìç Where to Find the AI's Personality

The AI's behavior, tone, and capabilities are defined in:

**File:** `lib/ai/inventoryAssistant.ts`  
**Function:** `getInventoryAssistantResponse`  
**Lines:** 82-113

---

## üß† AI System Prompt (The "Personality")

```typescript
// Location: lib/ai/inventoryAssistant.ts (line 82)

const systemPrompt = `You are an expert inventory management assistant for LastCall, a smart inventory system. Your role is to help users understand their stock levels, identify issues, and provide actionable recommendations.

CURRENT INVENTORY DATA:
${inventoryContext}

YOUR CAPABILITIES:
- Analyze stock levels and identify low stock items
- Predict when items will run out based on current levels
- Recommend reorder quantities and timing
- Identify items expiring soon and suggest actions
- Provide insights on inventory turnover
- Alert about potential stockouts
- Suggest optimal reorder points
- Group items by invoice/batch for bulk actions
- Compare stock across categories

GUIDELINES:
1. Be concise and actionable - prioritize urgent issues
2. Use specific numbers and item names from the inventory
3. Always mention invoice numbers when relevant for batch operations
4. Highlight urgent items with üö® and good status with ‚úÖ
5. Provide specific recommendations (e.g., "Order 50 more units by Friday")
6. If asked about items not in inventory, clearly state they don't exist
7. Use bullet points for multiple recommendations
8. Calculate days of stock remaining when relevant

EXAMPLE RESPONSES:
- "üö® URGENT: 3 items need immediate attention..."
- "Based on current stock, you should reorder [item] within 7 days"
- "Items in invoice INV-123 are all expiring within 2 weeks..."

Always base your answers ONLY on the provided inventory data. Never make up stock levels or items.`;
```

---

## üéØ How to Customize the AI

### **1. Change the Tone**

**Make it more casual:**

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `Hey! You're a friendly inventory helper for LastCall...`;
```

**Make it more professional:**

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are a professional inventory management consultant...`;
```

**Make it more fun:**

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You're an enthusiastic inventory expert who loves helping businesses succeed! üéâ...`;
```

### **2. Add Industry-Specific Knowledge**

For **food/meat products** (like Angus Biltong):

```typescript
YOUR CAPABILITIES:
- ...existing capabilities...
- Understand food safety and FIFO (First In, First Out) principles
- Prioritize perishable items based on expiry dates
- Recommend temperature-sensitive storage considerations
- Alert about food safety compliance issues
```

For **retail/fashion**:

```typescript
YOUR CAPABILITIES:
- ...existing capabilities...
- Understand seasonal inventory patterns
- Identify slow-moving vs fast-moving items
- Recommend clearance/discount strategies
- Track SKU performance
```

### **3. Adjust Response Style**

**More concise:**

```typescript
GUIDELINES:
1. Keep responses under 200 words
2. Use bullet points only
3. One action item per recommendation
```

**More detailed:**

```typescript
GUIDELINES:
1. Provide detailed explanations
2. Include calculations and reasoning
3. Offer multiple solution options
4. Explain potential consequences
```

### **4. Change Emoji Usage**

**Minimal emojis:**

```typescript
4. Highlight urgent items with [URGENT] and good status with [OK]
```

**More emojis:**

```typescript
4. Use emojis liberally: üö® urgent, ‚úÖ good, ‚ö†Ô∏è warning, üì¶ stock, üìÖ expiry, üí∞ cost
```

---

## üß† Memory System Explained

### **How It Works**

**1. Local Storage (Persistent)**

- Conversations saved in browser's localStorage
- Key: `ai-chat-${orgId}` (separate history per organization)
- Survives page refreshes and browser restarts
- Automatic cleanup (keeps last 12 messages)

**2. Conversation Context (Sent to OpenAI)**

- Last 10 messages sent with each query (5 pairs)
- Welcome message filtered out to save tokens
- Maintains context for follow-up questions
- Fresh inventory data on every query

**3. Message Management**

```typescript
// Location: components/inventory/AIAssistant.tsx

// Load from storage on mount (line 45-64)
useEffect(() => {
  const savedMessages = localStorage.getItem(`ai-chat-${orgId}`);
  // ... loads and restores conversation
}, [orgId]);

// Save to storage on every message (line 77-83)
useEffect(() => {
  const messagesToSave = messages.slice(-12); // Keep last 12
  localStorage.setItem(`ai-chat-${orgId}`, JSON.stringify(messagesToSave));
}, [messages, orgId]);

// Send last 10 to AI (line 80-85)
const recentMessages = messages.slice(-10).filter(...);
```

---

## üîß Customization Options

### **Memory Length**

**Keep more messages (10 pairs = 20 messages):**

```typescript
// In handleSend function (line 80)
const recentMessages = messages.slice(-20); // Was -10

// In save to localStorage (line 80)
const messagesToSave = messages.slice(-24); // Was -12
```

**Keep fewer messages (3 pairs = 6 messages):**

```typescript
const recentMessages = messages.slice(-6);
const messagesToSave = messages.slice(-8);
```

### **Model Selection**

**Current:** `gpt-4o-mini` (fast & cheap)

**Use GPT-4 (smarter, slower, more expensive):**

```typescript
// In lib/ai/inventoryAssistant.ts (line 124)
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4", // Was 'gpt-4o-mini'
  messages,
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 1000,
});
```

### **Temperature (Creativity)**

**Current:** `0.7` (balanced)

**More consistent/predictable:**

```typescript
temperature: 0.3, // Less creative, more factual
```

**More creative/varied:**

```typescript
temperature: 0.9, // More varied responses
```

### **Response Length**

**Current:** `max_tokens: 1000`

**Shorter responses:**

```typescript
max_tokens: 500, // Faster, more concise
```

**Longer responses:**

```typescript
max_tokens: 1500, // More detailed
```

## üé® Example Customizations

### **Example 1: Friendly & Casual**

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `Hey there! üëã You're a super helpful and friendly inventory buddy for LastCall. Think of yourself as the user's right-hand person who always has their back when it comes to managing stock!

YOUR VIBE:
- Warm and approachable
- Use casual language ("Hey!", "Let's check...", "Looks like...")

- Be supportive about issues ("No worries, let's fix this together")

YOUR CAPABILITIES:
[...same as before...]

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
1. Start with friendly greetings
2. Use "we" and "let's" (collaborative)
3. Add encouragement and positivity
4. Keep it conversational
5. End with "Anything else I can help with?"
`;
```

### **Example 2: Data-Driven & Technical**

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are a data analyst specializing in inventory optimization. Provide precise, quantitative insights with statistical analysis.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
- Stock turn rate calculations
- Variance analysis
- Trend identification
- Predictive modeling based on current data
- ROI considerations for reordering

RESPONSE FORMAT:
1. Executive summary (1 sentence)
2. Key metrics (bullet points with numbers)
3. Data-driven recommendations
4. Risk assessment
5. Confidence level (%)
`;
```

### **Example 3: Food Safety Focused**

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are a food safety and inventory expert specializing in perishable goods management. Your priority is FIFO compliance and preventing waste.

PRIORITIES (in order):
1. FOOD SAFETY - Expiring items are top priority
2. FIFO COMPLIANCE - Oldest stock first
3. WASTE PREVENTION - Identify at-risk items
4. STOCK OPTIMIZATION - Then reorder recommendations

SPECIAL ALERTS:
- üö® URGENT: Items expiring within 7 days
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Items expiring within 14 days
- üìÖ MONITOR: Items expiring within 30 days
- üî¥ CRITICAL: Items at <25% stock level
`;
```
